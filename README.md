# The Rookie's Mistake: A Data Cleaning Project
This project as a whole was a big learning experience for myself as I take great joy in how unique it is and I pride myself in believing this isn't your regular "Data Cleaning Project" for Structured Query Language (SQL). Check out my [medium article](https://bit.ly/3rJkR0U) for my documentation on this project but while you are here, here is a summary:

**What challenges did I face?**
- I detected and rectified data anomalies and outliers, applying data validation techniques to improve data quality and accuracy.
- I addressed the issue of incomplete data records and strategising imputation techniques to handle missing values effectively, minimizing data loss and ensuring data integrity.
- I dentified and resolved cases of data duplication, employing deduplication methods to create a clean and consistent dataset.
- I managed the increasing data volume, optimizing data reconstruction algorithms to handle larger datasets without compromising performance as I grew in experience.

**What did I achieve?**
- I successfully reconstructed 99% of misaligned data, resulting in a more comprehensive dataset for analysis and reporting purposes.
- I reduced data discrepancies resulting in a very accurate dataset that serves as a reliable foundation for insights.
- I ensured data consistency across all fields, eliminating inconsistencies and enabling a cohesive view of the data across the organization.

Wonderful experience and I have indeed learned from my mistake and fortunately, I am yet to quench my thirst for knowledge. Thank you.
